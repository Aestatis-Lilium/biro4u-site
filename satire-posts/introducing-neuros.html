      <h2>Introducing neurOS™: Your Dreams Are My Profits!</h2>
      
      <p>What if I told you your thoughts were an untapped asset? I am THRILLED to announce I have developed a way to quantify and measure cognition and I’m on my way to patent it.</p>
      
      <p>I call it… <strong>neurOS™</strong></p>
      
      <p>With neurOS™, it is FINALLY possible to put a price on cognition! Everything from paranoia to daydreaming—we can now IN REAL TIME assign monetary value to your neural activity. Soon, payment will be collected (automatically) whenever any neural activity occurs in your body.</p>
      
      <p><strong>WORRY NOT.</strong></p>
      
      <p>We have embraced the future with DYNAMIC PRICING. Through this revolution in pricing and valuation, we can ensure more accurate pricing. Thinking during peak times will cost more, and power users will be charged premiums! Don’t think that cleverly budgeting down your neural activity will save you! You will begin incurring Neural Inactivity fees which start at $19.99.</p>
      
      <p>Built on revolutionary web 3.0 technology, NeuroCHAIN makes it possible to offer Thought Credits™ and Impulse NFTs™.</p>

      <h3>Our Product Line</h3>
      <p>We are currently developing new additions to our product line:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Neural Wallet™:</strong> A digital wallet that allows you to store your neural activity for later and to earn interest by staking your neural activity to NeuroCHAIN.</li>
        <li><strong>NeuroScore™:</strong> A social ranking system based on cognitive efficiency.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Don’t just think—<strong>OWN</strong> your cognition.</p>
      <p>Your dreams, our profits!</p>
